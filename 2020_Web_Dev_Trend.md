# 2020 Web Dev Learning List

## Front End Necessary Skill

### Tools 1: Basic System Tools for Web Development

- Text Editor: VSCode
- Web Browser: Chrome
- Design and Mockup: Adobe XD
- Terminal: iterm2, Bash

### HTML & CSS

- The Building Blocks, HTML and CSS are almost always the first thing you want to learn in web dev - HTML5 (Semantic Elements, most important) - CSS Basics (Positioning, box model, etc,) - Flexbox and CSS Grid (The best addition to CSS) - CSS variables (custom properties) (new features) - Browser Dev Tools - CSS transitions
- Responsive Design: - Every serious project that you create should look good and be completely usable on all devices.
- Custom Reusable CSS Components: - Create your own modular, reusable CSS components to use in your projects. Frameworks seem to be a bit less popular.
- CSS Frameworks

### Bring Life to your websites

    - Vanilla Javascript
    - Tools 2: Some tools that you may want to work with as a front-end developer
    - Basic Deployment: You should know how to get your websites/apps on to a web server

### Front-End Framework:

- frameworks allow us to build powerful single page applications with organized and interactive UIs, also good for teams.

### State Management:

For larger apps, 3rd party state managers may be needed, however, look forward to using them less, use the Framework integrated statemanagement like Context API in react with HOOKs

### Server Side Rendering (NEXT)

Render React and Vue on the server as oppose to a client side SPA using NEXT and NUXT - (File System Routing) - Better SEO

### Static Site Generator

Gatsby (react) and Gridsome (vue) are expalmes of static site generator.

### TypeScript: Superset of Javascript that allows you to use optional static typing as well as support for the latest eveloving features of ES2015

## Back End Skills

- Server Side Language: to be a fullstack or backend developer, you will need to learn a server-side programming lanugage/technology. (Node.js is still the best, since you are using the same language for both frontend and backend)

- Server Side Framework: For each backend language you will found a matching server-side framework
- Database
- GraphQL
- Content Mangagement System
- Deployment & DevOps: Understand how to create/manage environments and deploy to the web

## Beyond Fullstack

- Mobile Development: - Flutter: SDK from Google to build native mobile apps, uses Dart (Mix of Javascript and Java) - React Native - build native mobile apps using the React framework - NativeScript - lonic: Javascript - Xamarin: C#

- PWA: progress web apps: PWAs are reugular web apps but have native feel as far as experience, layout and functionality that feel like native mobile app - look greate on all screen sizes - offline content with service workers - installable (cool!) - splash screen - must be HTTPS - reliable, fast and engaing

- Desktop App With Electron (Best tech): Electron allows us to cross-platform desktop applications with Javascript - Uses Node.js & Chromium - High Data Security - Accessibility - Examples: VSCode, Atom, Postman

## 2020 Trend

- JAM stack - Javascript, APIs and Markup (done by satic site generator) - A mordern Web development architecture based on client-side Javascript, reusable APIs and prebuilt Markup - No restriction on framework or library - Websites are served as static HTML files generated from sources files, such as markdown using a static site generator like Gatsby - High performance, generated at deploy time - Chaper and easier to scale - Easy to host (Netlify)
- Serverless Architecture - Server operations without actually needing your own server

      	- "Backend" or "Functions" as a service (FaaS)
      	- Reduce complexity and costs
      	- Less infrastructure to manage
      	- AWS or Netflify

- API-First Design - With more and more IoT (internet of things) expect to see api-focused design - Traditionally, we start with the UI and then move to the backend with a strict connection to the web app - With API-first Design, you start with the appropriate APIs and then build products on top of it.

- Machine Learning/ AI and The Web - Machine learning and AI are growing in all areas of tech and can be useful in web apps/services - Alternative to conventional data mining - Remove security threats - Machining learning APIs - producing content (AI generation algorithm) - study user behavior - etc.

* Speech Recognition - Speech recognition is a major trend in tech, In 2020, expect to see more of this in web apps, especially with search - HTML5 Web Speech API - Google Speech-to-Text - Dialog Flow

* Web Assembly.
